Smart Energy Consumption Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Scope
To build a system that monitors, analyzes, and predicts smart home energy consumption using machine learning, providing users with device-level insights, visualizations, and energy-saving suggestions through a web dashboard.

Functional Objectives:
Collect and preprocess timestamped energy data.
Analyze usage patterns across devices and time periods.
Predict future consumption using Linear Regression and LSTM.
Visualize insights with interactive charts.
Provide smart energy-saving recommendations.
Deploy the system using a Flask-based web application.
